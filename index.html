            <h3>Dear Friends,</h3><br/>
            <p>    
                On behalf of everyone at Sightsource, we would like to thank you for your business, support, and trust this year.<br/><br/>
              
                It has been an exciting one to say the least. Aside from delivering projects as we have done for the past 9 years,
                  in 2018 we also did many new things. We trained 40+ people free of charge to become full stack software developers.
                  We opened two offices in Winston-Salem, NC and Richmond, VA. We also expanded our team by 6 new full time software developers and three contractors.<br/><br/>
              
                The training program was called <Empower>, and it was such a success that we ended up hiring six of the participants as full time employees. 
                  Ashley, Melissa, Sacha, Blake, Henry, and Scott are great additions to our team, and we look forward to many years of growth and fun with them.<br/><br/>
              
                Our offices at Winston Starts (W-S, NC) and Gather - Short Pump (Richmond, VA) both put us at 
                  the heart of the local entrepreneurial ecosystems, and we hope to have you visit one or both in the new year.<br/><br/>
              
                2019 promises to be another exciting year, marked by continued growth, new partnerships, and possibly another edition of <Empower>,
                  since our phones and emails have yet to stop getting pinged by interested prospective participants.<br/><br/>
              
                Thank you again for being a part of our extended Sightsource family. We wish you and yours a joyful Holiday Season and a healthy, happy, and successful 2019!<br/><br/>
              
              Sincerely,
              
              The Sightsource Team
